<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->



Hi! I'm a Master's student in Budapest University of Technology and Economics. My research interests broadly span computer vision, machine learning and computer graphics. In particular, I am interested in [Radiance Fields](https://radiancefields.com/) and their applications in [Virtual Reality (VR)](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/nerf-vr-contest/) and [Autonomous Driving (AD)](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring23-s51770/). I am also excited about the creation of the next generation of media using Radiance Fields!

Outside of research, I am also concerned about the safety and reliability of AI. Besides, I am a devoted fan of [trustworthy AI](https://scalabletrustworthyai.github.io/). To this end, I registered the course: [Artificial intelligence and Law](https://hcaim.bme.hu/) and attended the [1st Probabilistic Numerics Spring School](https://www.probabilistic-numerics.org/meetings/2023_SpringSchool/). In addition, for the final project in the [Computer vision systems](https://portal.vik.bme.hu/kepzes/targyak/VIIIMA07) course, I implemented a [Gaussian Processes (GPs)](./assets/pdf/GPs.pdf) model for few-shot image classification with uncertainty estimation. 

<!-- % My research interests broadly span computer graphics, computer vision, and machine learning. In particular, I am interested in [neural fields](https://neuralfields.cs.brown.edu/) and their combination with [differentiable](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/nglod/) [data structures](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/vqad/) as a new compressed data format for immersive multimedia (3D JPEG!). I am also excited about their [use in generative AI](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/magic3d/), especially for the purpose of enabling artists to create amazing things.

% Outside of research, I enjoy working on open source software like [Kaolin](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/kaolin) and [Kaolin Wisp](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/kaolin-wisp). I generally enjoy straddling the line between research and engineering.

% I also enjoy teaching, so let me know if you want a tutorial on 3D representations beyond meshes, NeRFs, neural fields, or 3D generative modeling!

% I come from a small town in Oregon named Corvallis, but these days I hang out in the multicultural center of the world, Toronto. When I am not working I play music (violin and guitar) and sports (mostly basketball these days)!
